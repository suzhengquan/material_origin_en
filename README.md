# Substance origin

   The Bible is a teaching written by more advanced civilizations to advanced civilizations,
   spread in a religion manner (spreading among civilizations in various galaxies,the content 
   and media used by each stage node are different).What kind of ideology, and what kind of civilization generate,
   what kind of civilization generated, and what kind of technology invented.Inferior civilizations 
   do not deserve advanced technology,the innate formation of advanced ideology is more perfect,and character 
   is the most important.(A beauty spirit,the beautiful soul will be collected).

   #### The fountain of energy for all things:mass (granular fluid)(God's capacitance)('Glory' of God fountain product),inherit the last wish of God and lead all things.

   吸收红外电粒子的能量(频率跳跃，自旋，移动加速度的动能)，帮助其他电粒子(红外
频率以外，临界值暂时不明确，与质的冠幅有关)充电。质的力由质与质所传导，质被质场所吸引，并且
受质场力的方向与力的加速度传导所影响(质作为一份子加入到质场中)。与质场的源距离越远，力的加
速度越小，反之亦然(1元的磁铁肯定比不上100元的)。由于地球质场影响，同一光源，向下照的光比向
上照的光快两个地球重力加速度。由于受红外电粒子(不是迁跃情况，而是在同个质中跳跃)的影响，主要是
因为红外电子受质的牵引，由于自旋原因红外电子以圆轨路径在质里颤动，质被撑大，所以物质表现出
热涨冷缩特性。若非有足够的加速度，质与质之间不可逾越，反之则可以。(这里有件事不确定的就是质
与质是否相互吸收形成饱和，还是相互充电形成均衡，如果按神的想法公平更重要，则后者可能性更高
，也解释宇宙在膨胀的原因。膨胀也间接表明很多星球在产生高频电子，产生更多的质，处于不稳定的
状态，无限的膨胀以后将成为新的问题)。没有个性的质只能随流(质场)。有个性的质可以一飞冲天，漫
游星际。

   #### Electrons(with frequency flutter, the spinning mass generates a mass field and forms electrons. If one of them is zero, the electrons disappear and the mass remains)
   Usually, the collision between mass (with electrons in general) and mass (with electrons in general) consumes 
   the capacity of these two masses and allocates a new mass to form the direction and acceleration of 
   movement(Calculate using vector method. The speed of light is very fast and difficult to capture, but 
   the speed of light is not a constant, and in most cases it is at a different speed).Volt does not use a 
   positive or negative description, but rather uses the spin direction to determine the relative direction and 
   opposite direction (universal, calculated using vector method), and the strength of the spin determines the 
   electric voltage(volt, proportional, relative strong, relative weak).Electric frequency forming the contour of 
   electrons(Like a gear)，the lower the frequency, the larger the tooth width (gear concept),and the higher the frequency, 
   the smaller the tooth width, like a circle(infinite proximity circle).When the tooth width (a half) is greater than the mass
   crown width,electrons will migrated between masses(When electrons are pulled by the mass to break through the mass field, 
   they will consume some spin kinetic energy, which can be understood as a part capacitor of mass has migrated to another mass),
   until electrons disappears.Electronic frequency (flutter/migrated) speed > Mass field force transmission velocity (without electronic effects)>Speed of 
   light (with electronic effects, final vector value, direction of mass movement and acceleration)

   Radio waves is strung together and coherent electrical particles,the electric particles's frequency,
   direction of movement and acceleration is general same. And the spin direction and spin intensity is varying.

   Regarding the propagation of sound waves, it is necessary to have a gas that has an effect on the 
   mass field (substance with extranuclear mass/capacitance),the sound source vibrates the gas, which generates 
   force transmission on the mass field,mass field that transmits force to extranuclear mass of other substances,causing 
   oscillation.(Even if the force is small, attaching these forces is like calculating the mixing voice effect,
   think about the explosion and noise from beyond in 2012 years)

   #### Neutron
The electric particle (y frequency) collides with the electric particle from behind and is enveloped 
(moving in the same direction, accelerating faster, so it catches up),form internal entanglement. The collided 
electric particle flipped inside and out,so the neutron outer wall exhibits a relatively opposite characteristic.
Neutrons that are independent and stationary can be destroyed by slight heating.

   #### Mass field
   Composed of the direction and the acceleration(vector concept).Regarding the three major fields of physics 
   in force field science: gravitational field, magnetic field, and electric field,they are all the same things, 
   all are caused by mass, collectively referred to as the mass field.Because mass is a fluid, a mass field can 
   be formed by one or more masses (using vector methods to calculate the direction and acceleration of the final force).

   Giant magnetic levitation and space pulses require understanding and manufacturing the mass field.

   Chemistry substance's truth is physics.So all problems with substance should be explained using 
   physics, rather than using Sudoku (mathematical games).Remarkable achievements does not need fuzzy.

    #### Lithium atom (as shown in the figure)
    The mass is entwined with electrons within the nucleus (as shown in the diagram, actually mass connected 
    into one piece, forming an insurmountable outer shell of substance), and due to the mass field effect, the 
    fierce convex part is excited squeezed, the mass field overflows to form extranuclear mass (red region, original 
    extranuclear electrons concept)
